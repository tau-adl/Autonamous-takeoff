# Autonamous-takeoff
Project by Lauren(e) Bouskila and Shir Barlas

This project is based on https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python
Replace src/cfclient/ui/main.py with this file.

Run the client and connect to the Crazyflie.
If you tilt your Crazyflie more than 10 degrees in either direction, it will automatically takeoff and hover for 10 seconds.
